# Personal website

The aim of this repository is to host the structure of my [personal website](https://simop07.github.io/).

Website's base template is provided by [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/), from which the code was forked and, further, implemented.
